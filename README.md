This tool will analyze and enrich the submitter pivot table as generated by https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-submitter-stats


## Quick Start

To extract the top submitter from the pivot table, use `jenkins-contribution-aggregator extract [input file]`  where `input file` is the pivot table. Although other other values can be specified, the default output file will be 
"top-submitters.csv". The top 35 submitters will be computed over the last 12 months. 

The proper format of the input pivot table can verified with the CHECK command. the format is `jenkins-contribution-aggregator check [input file]`, where `input file` is the pivot table to validate.

Full documentation can be found [here](docs/documentation.md).

## Installation

Download the distribution for your operating system from [/jenkins-contribution-aggregator/releases](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-contribution-aggregator/releases).

The following versions are available:

* Mac OS (AMD64 and ARM64 processors)
* Linux (386, AMD64, and ARM64 processors)
* Windows (386 processors)

## Expected input format

An example of the input data is available as [short_overview.csv](test_data/short_overview.csv) in 
the `test_data` directory.

The first line of the csv contains the names of the different columns. The first column is the contributor's
name (generally an empty column name). The following columns, containing the number of submitted pull requests 
for a given month, are labeled as `"MM-YYYY"`. The items are separated by a comma (`,`). There are no spaces

The contributor name must be entered between quotes. The number of PR is a plain integer number.

## Installation

For MacOS users, `homebrew` is the easiest installation method.

- add the Homebrew tap with `brew tap jenkins-infra/tap`.
- install the application with `brew install jenkins-contribution-aggregator`.
